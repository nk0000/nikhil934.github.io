	    <p>Welcome to the my personal website!. I am Nikhil Kaushik, a software engineer by profession and a traveller by passion. I have been in the IT indistry since last ~4 years. Talking about my graduation, I have completed B.E in CSE from Chandigarh University.
            I have created a lot small projects from my end and I am ready to take up more. As I said, I am a travelled, so I travel a lot like every two months I will be at a new place :)

	    <p> I am a great team-player too, and I have a great sense of humor (In my opinion :p) and thus a fun person to be around with.
            I am an open person whom you can talk about anything-anytime, and once we get to know each other, we can make really good friends.
