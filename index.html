	    <p> As I said, I am a traveller, so I love to explore new places :) <br> I am a great team-player too, and I have a great sense of humor (In my opinion :p) and thus a fun person to be around with.
            I am an open person whom you can talk about anything-anytime, and once we get to know each other, we can make really good friends.
